# LEGO-Island-2-Patcher
This tool will allow users to easily apply patches to the PC game LEGO Island 2: The Brickster's Revenge.

-Force /force command line

-Disable (or make skippable) the LEGO Software logo

Note: This program will automatically make a backup of your LEGO Island 2.exe file. Do not delete it, as it is used to remove patches.
